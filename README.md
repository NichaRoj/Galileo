The code family finder for new TU students

### So what does it do?
Nothing too complicated - it just matches students' data and group them into their respective code families.

### Is it safe & secure?
Yes it is! The project's open-sourced here, so feel free to play around. Should there be bugs, please open an issue here on GitHub (or create a patch and make a pull request!)
